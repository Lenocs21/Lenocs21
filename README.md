Hello, Nice to meet you! Now I study about aerospace engineering and programming, and English. It's tough for me to study such the first 2 technical contents in English, but it's also fun for me!
Yet I can't speak English fluently but friends around me help me every time.
My dream is to be an engineer of designing a special rocket which can carry many people to the far universe in the far future.
Nice to meet you!
